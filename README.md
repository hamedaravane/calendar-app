- **Delete an Appointment**: Click the delete icon on an appointment and confirm the action.
- **Drag and Drop**: Click and hold an appointment to drag it to a new time slot or date.

## Technical Implementation

### Angular Features and Patterns Used

- **Dependency Injection**: Utilized throughout the application for services and components.
- **Lazy Loading**: Modules and routes are lazy-loaded to improve performance.
- **Routing**: Implemented with `RouterModule` and `router-outlet` for navigation.
- **Reactive Forms**: Used `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and validators for the appointment form.
- **Value Changes and Validators**: Dynamic form validation and updates based on user input.
- **RxJS**: Employed for reactive programming, including observables and operators like `pipe` and `subscribe`.
- **Standalone Components**: Leveraged Angular's standalone component feature for modularity.
- **Angular Material and CDK**: Used for UI components and implementing Drag & Drop functionality.
- **NgFor and NgIf Directives**: Rendered calendar dates and appointments dynamically.
- **Date Handling with Date()**: Managed dates and times using JavaScript's `Date` object.
